# Zomato Data Analysis Project 📊

This project focuses on analyzing the Zomato dataset using various data exploration and visualization techniques. It aims to uncover insights into restaurant ratings, pricing, and locations through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.

## Project Overview

The objective of this analysis is to extract meaningful insights from the Zomato dataset through:
- **Univariate Analysis**: 🎯 Examining individual variables like restaurant ratings, pricing, and location distributions.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: 🔗 Investigating relationships between two variables to understand their interdependencies.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: 🌐 Exploring the interactions between multiple variables to reveal complex patterns.

## Visualizations

This project leverages a range of visual techniques:
- **Univariate Visualizations**: 📈 Histograms and bar charts to show variable distributions.
- **Bivariate Visualizations**: 📊 Scatter plots and box plots to study relationships, e.g., price vs. rating.
- **Multivariate Visualizations**: 🌍 Heatmaps and pair plots to examine interactions across multiple variables.

## Key Insights

- Higher-rated restaurants tend to cluster in specific regions, suggesting geographic influences.
- Pricing is not always a strong predictor of ratings, hinting at other influential factors like service quality.
- A combination of location, cuisine type, and restaurant attributes plays a significant role in influencing ratings.

## Environment Setup ⚙️

To run this analysis, you’ll need to have the following tools and libraries installed.

### Prerequisites
