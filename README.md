# Data Analysis Projects 📊

Welcome to this repository, where I document my journey through data analysis. This space features a series of projects aimed at building a solid understanding of data exploration, statistical analysis, and data preprocessing techniques.

## About This Repository

- **Continuous Learning**: These projects reflect my hands-on experience with data analysis, applying key methodologies to real-world datasets. The goal is to enhance both my technical skills and understanding of data-driven insights.
  
- **Project Categories**:
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 🧐 In-depth analysis of datasets to uncover trends and patterns.
  - **Statistical Analysis**: 📈 Application of statistical methods to derive actionable insights.
